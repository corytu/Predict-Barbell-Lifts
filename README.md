# Predict-Dumbbell-Lifts
_Prediction Assignment of "Practical Machine Learning" on Coursera_

I used support vector machine, decision tree, and random forests techniques to predict whether participants are executing dumbbell lifts correctly. The data were generated from sensors on arm, forearm, belt, and dumbbell respectively. The cross-validations show that random forests have the best accuracy, and the results of random forests have 20/20 correct predictions for the testing dataset.
